Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
