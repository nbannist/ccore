Because CCore content is used across multiple websites and applications, all content creation and editing is done by content teams, who can coordinate changes with all stakeholders and determine the best way to approach information needs. These teams are dedicated to managing content and can prepare changes well before they need to be published. However, if you see anything inaccurate in CCore content, you can let these teams know; see our <a href="/contact">Contact page</a> for more.

Future versions of CCore applications will enable some direct edits by authorized users, such as managers being able to create descriptions for their teams or services, and individual user-editable profiles.
