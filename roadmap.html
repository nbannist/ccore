content="Digital Campus Content Systems (formerly Digital Communications Development (DCD)) maintains several applications that provide content for UITS via single-sourcing — which allows authoritative information to be delivered for multiple uses and to multiple destinations — with several more in the queue for future development. Our primary direction for 2019 is to take intentional steps toward integrating these various applications and building a cohesive platform for content management at Indiana University."

</ul>
<li>Improve development process transparency and provide structured processes for clients to submit issues, bugs, and feature requests.</li>
<ul>
<li>For each existing application, we will create a GitHub project with a public backlog of known issues and feature requests.</li>
<li>A process will be created to respond to each GitHub issue, either accepting the issue, merging it with another issue, modifying the issue, or rejecting it. This will all be done in plain sight within GitHub.</li>
<li>Publish project pages with information about work currently planned or in-process for each application, as well as information about planned changes in future sprints.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>CCore Services</strong> v1.0 (fka Serif) in production</li>
<li><strong>CCore People</strong> MVP:  Initial (read-only) deployment of People, as replacement for IT Pro Database, in partnership with ITCP and SSL; import and sanitization of Structure data from WCMS</li>
<ul>
<li>Prototyping of People admin client, for maintaining both organizational units, their structure, and membership (by HR, IT managers, and administrative assistants) and profile pages (by managers and individuals)</li>
</ul>
<li>Redesign the administrative interface for <strong>CCore Knowledge</strong> (fka KMSED) using Rivet and making modifications to better integrate with <strong>CCore Services</strong>; make the IU Knowledge Base Rivet-compatible.</li>
<li>Migrate <strong>CCore Knowledge</strong> to latest version of Java</li>
<li>Work with IT Communications Office (ITCO) and Knowledge Management (KM) to scope initial requirements for <strong>CCore Assets</strong>, a digital (rich-media) asset management system, including prototypes.</li>
