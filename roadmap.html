    content="Roadmap Digital Communications Development (DCD) maintains several applications that serve to provide content for UITS via single-sourcing — which allows authoritative information to be delivered for multiple uses and to multiple destinations — with several more in the queue for future development. Our primary direction for 2019 is to take intentional steps toward integrating these various applications and building a cohesive platform for content management at Indiana University."

            <p>Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!</p>
            <p>Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.</p>
            <p>Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter. Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.</p>
            <p>Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me?</p>
