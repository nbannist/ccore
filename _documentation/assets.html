Images are an important part of every IU design and the right visuals can take your marketing piece from ordinary to
outstanding. While it takes time and resources to find appropriate, high-quality photos to support your content,
the results speak for themselves. To connect with our brand messaging, we must use emotionally engaging, active
images that capture the spirit and strength of Indiana University. Stay away from stock photography if at all possible.
For more information about using images, visit the
<a href="https://brand.iu.edu/design/photography/index.html">photography section of the brand guidelines website</a>.
